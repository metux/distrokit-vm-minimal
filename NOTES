* virtio-mmio needs acpi disabled
* smbios/dmi tables only work w/ normal x87 machine type (not microvm)

## NOTE: virtio-mmio currently only works when acpi is disabled
## maybe a bug in seabios+qemu not passing through the device data ?
## or is the kernel incapable of probing from acpi ?

## NOTE: poweroff only works with ACPI !
